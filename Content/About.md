## Brief Overview 
### This website is designed and developed by Kirtan Patel & Alex Tello. Alex is an MBA candidate at Martin Tuchmanâ€™s School of Management and Kirtan is a MSIS candidate at Ying Wu College of Computing at NJIT, as a part of the Web Systems Development course curriculum. This website was created to provide information to the user on the history and how the internet works. Topics range from; DNS, ICANN, IP Address, HTTPS. Also included is a timeline leading back to 1956 when the internet was first created through reasearch done by ARPAN (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). 

### For this homework, you will take the outline that you created in the previous assignment and work with a partner (optionally) to create the basic information you will need for the website that you will create as the final project for this section of the course.  For this unit you will need to write the website content, select images, create metadata, and generally plan out the concept and content that will be the basis of your website. You can choose any topic or idea for your website that combines historical, technical, and/or information about companies that relate to the history and technology of the Internet. You will need to use Git and GitHub to collaborate and Markdown as the syntax for your content, so you don't need to use any HTML yet. The more thought and time you put into this, the better your project will come out. You should think about the overall concept of your website and the audience you intend to serve i.e. children, teens, adults, etc... This is a lot of work and I'm forcing you to collaborate with another person since the only way to learn Git  is to have to use it to work with someone else. It is much easier to learn GIT with just using plain text; rather than trying to learn it, while you are learning to code.
