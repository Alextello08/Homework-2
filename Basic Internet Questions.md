# What is the internet?
## * The internet is a large network of interconnected computers that uses the internet protocol
suite to communicate between groups of networks and devices. An experiment conducted by
the ARPAN (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the outcome of the internet.
Paul Baran, a computer network pioneer had the brilliant idea to build a communication
system that would survive a nuclear attack.

# Who oversees the internet?
## * The internet is a global distributed network that is comprised of many interconnected
independently operated networks that operates without a central governing body. Like the
telephone network no company or government can take claim to the whole thing. However,
many individuals’ companies and governments own certain fragments of it.

# What does the internet work?
## * The internet works as a simple function to use collect data and transfer it into a network. It
serves its users by using this data collected and storing it for a lifetime. Before the internet
there were letters or postcards which can easily be lost or even destroyed. But with the
internet this information can be stored for a lifetime and more.

# How does Internet data move?
## * Most data over the internet moves by packet switching. Packet switching is the transfer of
small pieces of data across various networks. These data chunks or “packets” enables a faster
and more efficient data transfer. When a user sends a file across a network, it is transferred
into smaller data packets, not in one piece. For example, what if you decided to dismantle
your house brick by brick, number each brick put them in a box and mail them separately to
Canada? All the bricks that you mailed can travel by separate routes. For example, brick
number 1 can travel by ship, brick number 2 can travel by air. Some might travel quicker
than others, but none of that matters if it arrives at its designated destination. Once all the
bricks arrive you can put them back together to recreate your house. By mailing your bricks,
this would not affect any other person’s mail because the bricks would be traveling parallel
over many separate routes at the same times, they would probably arrive much quicker.
Similarly, packet switching works in the same manner. When you send an email, the data is
split up into various packets that travel separately over the internet.
